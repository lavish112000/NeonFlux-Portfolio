# Code Review Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for conducting thorough code reviews in the NeonFlux Portfolio project.

## Pre-Review Setup âœ…

- [ ] Pull the latest changes from the main branch
- [ ] Run `npm run check-all` to verify:
  - [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
  - [ ] ESLint rules pass
  - [ ] Prettier formatting is correct
- [ ] Build the project with `npm run build`
- [ ] Review the PR description and linked issues

## 1. Functional Correctness âœ…

### Does the code work as intended?
- [ ] **Purpose Understanding**: The changes align with the PR description and requirements
- [ ] **Problem Solving**: The implementation addresses the specific issue or feature request
- [ ] **Manual Testing**: Test the functionality manually (run `npm run dev`)
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Consider boundary conditions and unusual inputs
- [ ] **Integration**: New code integrates properly with existing functionality

### Testing Verification
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Adequate test coverage for new/changed code
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests cover both happy path and edge cases
- [ ] **Test Execution**: All tests pass (`npm test` when available)
- [ ] **Manual Verification**: UI changes verified through browser testing

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability âœ…

### Readability
- [ ] **Clear Naming**: Variables, functions, and components have descriptive names
- [ ] **Self-Documenting**: Code is easy to understand without extensive comments
- [ ] **Consistent Style**: Follows project coding conventions (enforced by ESLint/Prettier)
- [ ] **Logical Structure**: Code organization makes sense and follows patterns

### Simplicity
- [ ] **Minimal Complexity**: Solution is as simple as possible while meeting requirements
- [ ] **No Over-Engineering**: Avoids unnecessary abstractions or premature optimization
- [ ] **Clear Intent**: The purpose of each piece of code is obvious
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component has a single, well-defined purpose

### Modularity
- [ ] **Proper Separation**: Logic is broken into appropriate components/functions
- [ ] **Reusability**: Common functionality is extracted into reusable components
- [ ] **Loose Coupling**: Components are not overly dependent on each other
- [ ] **Component Structure**: React components follow best practices

### Scalability
- [ ] **Performance**: Code won't create performance bottlenecks
- [ ] **Memory Management**: No obvious memory leaks or excessive memory usage
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Easy to extend without major refactoring
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: New dependencies are justified and don't bloat the bundle

## 3. Consistency Checks âœ…

### Coding Style (Automated)
- [ ] **ESLint Rules**: All ESLint rules pass (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] **Prettier Formatting**: Code is properly formatted (`npm run format:check`)
- [ ] **TypeScript**: Type safety maintained (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] **Import Organization**: Imports follow the configured order

### Manual Style Review
- [ ] **Component Patterns**: Follows established React patterns in the project
- [ ] **Styling Approach**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes consistently
- [ ] **File Organization**: Files are placed in appropriate directories
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Follows project naming conventions

### Documentation
- [ ] **JSDoc Comments**: Complex functions have appropriate documentation
- [ ] **Component Props**: TypeScript interfaces document expected props
- [ ] **README Updates**: Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Only necessary comments that explain "why", not "what"

## 4. Bug Prevention and Edge Cases âœ…

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Input Validation**: User inputs are properly validated
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries in place where needed
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: App handles errors gracefully
- [ ] **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks where appropriate

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Null/Undefined**: Proper handling of null/undefined values
- [ ] **Empty States**: UI handles empty data gracefully
- [ ] **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators
- [ ] **Network Failures**: API call failures handled properly

### Accessibility
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Proper HTML semantics used
- [ ] **ARIA Labels**: Accessibility attributes where needed
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Content is screen reader friendly

## 5. Security Considerations âœ…

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: No dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Forms use proper CSRF protection
- [ ] **Sensitive Data**: No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data

### Dependencies
- [ ] **Dependency Security**: No known vulnerabilities in new dependencies
- [ ] **Minimal Permissions**: Dependencies have minimal required permissions
- [ ] **Trusted Sources**: Dependencies from trusted sources only
- [ ] **Version Pinning**: Dependencies use specific versions

## 6. Performance Considerations âœ…

### React Performance
- [ ] **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Components don't re-render unnecessarily
- [ ] **Memoization**: useMemo/useCallback used appropriately
- [ ] **Component Splitting**: Large components split appropriately
- [ ] **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting implemented where beneficial

### General Performance
- [ ] **Algorithm Efficiency**: Algorithms are reasonably efficient
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks or excessive memory consumption
- [ ] **Network Requests**: API calls are optimized and cached when appropriate
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Images are properly optimized (Next.js Image component)

## 7. Next.js Specific Checks âœ…

### Framework Best Practices
- [ ] **App Router**: Proper use of App Router patterns
- [ ] **Server Components**: Appropriate use of Server vs Client components
- [ ] **Metadata**: Proper metadata configuration
- [ ] **Performance**: Image optimization and other Next.js features utilized

## 8. Review Process âœ…

### Constructive Feedback
- [ ] **Specific Comments**: Comments are specific and actionable
- [ ] **Positive Recognition**: Acknowledge good practices and clever solutions
- [ ] **Suggestions**: Provide alternative approaches when applicable
- [ ] **Learning Opportunities**: Share knowledge and best practices

### Approval Criteria
- [ ] **All Checks Pass**: Automated checks (ESLint, TypeScript, build) pass
- [ ] **Manual Review**: Manual code review completed satisfactorily
- [ ] **Testing**: Functionality tested and verified
- [ ] **Documentation**: Appropriate documentation provided

## Automated Tools Integration ðŸ”§

The following automated tools help enforce code quality:

- **ESLint**: Enforces coding standards and catches potential bugs
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and catches type-related errors
- **Husky**: Runs pre-commit hooks to prevent committing broken code
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline (when configured)

## Quick Commands ðŸš€

```bash
# Run all checks
npm run check-all

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run fix-all

# Individual checks
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check

# Fix formatting and linting
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```
