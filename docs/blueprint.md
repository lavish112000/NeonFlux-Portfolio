- Accent color: Neon purple (#A239CA), analogous to blue, used sparingly for secondary highlights and dynamic effects. #E30B5D
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear, modern text, ensuring high readability across all sections, including headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist icons with neon outlines to complement the 'Glassmorphism' style.
- Employ a grid-based layout for project cards to ensure responsiveness and a clean, organized presentation.
- Subtle animations for data visualizations and logo, including progress bars, dynamic charts, and a gentle pulsing effect for the 3D logo.
